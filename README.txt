Chess Position Memorize
=======================

A very simple game where the objectif is to fix/memorize/rebuild a given chess position.

A sample position definition
----------------------------
c8f4 # the board goes from top-left corner c8 to bottom-right corner f4
  k / ppp/    /QB R/    # the pieces definition from top to bottom (nearly the same as FEN notation : only spaces are differents)
